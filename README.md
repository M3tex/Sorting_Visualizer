# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
This is a small project built with python and Tkinter that allows to visualize different sorting algorithms\
Currently it supports these sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort: _**Currently bugged**_
- Quick Sort
I plan to add other sorting algorithms.

### Demonstration with Quick Sort
